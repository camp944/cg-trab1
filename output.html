<h2 id="descrição-do-projeto">Descrição do Projeto</h2>
<p>Este projeto é um jogo simples desenvolvido em C++ utilizando OpenGL
para renderização gráfica. O jogo envolve um jogador controlando uma
aeronave que deve enfrentar inimigos em diferentes níveis. O projeto é
estruturado em várias classes que gerenciam diferentes aspectos do jogo,
como renderização, eventos, objetos do jogo (jogador, inimigos, balas),
e a lógica dos níveis.</p>

<h3 id="arquivos-principais">Arquivos Principais</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application.h / Application.cpp</strong>: Gerencia a
inicialização do jogo e o loop principal.</li>
<li><strong>Window.h / Window.cpp</strong>: Configura a janela do jogo e
gerencia seu tamanho.</li>
<li><strong>Renderer.h / Renderer.cpp</strong>: Responsável pela
renderização dos objetos na tela.</li>
<li><strong>EventHandler.h / EventHandler.cpp</strong>: Configura e
gerencia os callbacks de eventos, como redimensionamento da janela e
entrada do teclado.</li>
<li><strong>Scene.h / Scene.cpp</strong>: Gerencia a cena do jogo,
incluindo o jogador, inimigos e a lógica de atualização do frame.</li>
<li><strong>Level.h / Level.cpp</strong>: Define a lógica dos níveis,
incluindo a configuração inicial e o controle dos NPCs (inimigos).</li>
<li><strong>GameObject.h / GameObject.cpp</strong>: Classe base para
todos os objetos do jogo, como jogador, inimigos e balas.</li>
<li><strong>Player.h / Player.cpp</strong>: Herda de GameObject e
adiciona funcionalidades específicas para o jogador.</li>
